    "section": "",
    "text": "Figure 3.1: Mind map of week 3\n\n\nThis week we mainly talk about two main section, one is correction, another is about images enhancement. There are lots of reasons cause images become incorrect, which will bring lots of inconvenience in further analysis. All these factors will bring some obstacles for our following research. In that case, it is necessary to correct and enhance images. Although there are many methods which can improve the quality of images, different methods need to be chosen carefully for different scenarios and purposes.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many factors which will cause the error of images, such as sensor device itself,terrain, the rotation of the earth and the atmospheric environment. From perspective of sensor devices, different devices will cause different errors. For instance, panoramic cameras can cause squeezing on both sides of the image, as for side-looking radar, due to the way it scans, causes one side of the image to be squeezed and the other side to be stretched. See Figure 3.2 for an illustration(Zhan 2001).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Image distortion\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the Earth rotates with not only linear but also angular velocity, when the sensor device acquires an image around the Earth at a certain linear velocity, there will be some deviation in the image.See Figure 3.3 for an illustration.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Distortion for rotating\n\n\n\n\n\nTopography and wind are main factors which cause image distortion as well. Specifically, the image points will be displaced due to changes in the height of the earth’s surface. However, different types of sensor devices (e.g. panoramic projection sensors and side view radars) have different types of pixel displacement patterns. There are different formulas for calculating displacement for different types of sensor devices(Zhan 2001). For example, the terrain displacement formula for the side view projection case is\n\\[d{y}\\approx-\\lambda\\times h\\times cos\\theta\\]\nAs for wind, it will always influence planes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is obvious that different methods have different benefits and limitations. To be specific, in the case of geometric correction, the first step is to transform the spatial position coordinates, which are divided into two methods: direct and indirect. Although the direct method does not change the size of the picture elements, they are not uniformly distributed in the output image. Therefore it is not the first choice. The indirect method, on the other hand, starts from the output image, calculates the position of each picture element in the original image in turn, and then calculates the pixel value at that position in the original image. However, its drawback is obvious as well: the positions of its calculated picture element points are not integers, so resample is the next step to solve the above problem(Chao 2018).\nIn the case of atmospheric correction, the main objective is to determine the true surface reflectance value by removing atmospheric effects from the satellite image. Atmospheric correction is arguably the most important part of satellite remote sensing data pre-processing(Themistocleous and Hadjimitsis 2008). However, it has the unavoidable disadvantage that it is almost impossible to perfectly correct every pixel point due to the difficulty of estimating aerosol and water vapour parameters(Liang, Li, and Wang 2012).\nOrthorectification correction plays an extremely important role in the face of complex terrain, specifically in the correction of terrain displacements(Satellite Imaging Corporation, n.d.), in which a digital elevation model ( DEM) is used to make the correction. The DEM is specifically composed of a TIN (Triangulated irregular network) and has the advantage of being able to vary the density of sampling points according to the complexity and to determine the location of the undulating terrain. It overcomes the problem of redundant data in areas with little topographic variation (using fewer triangles to collect a small amount of information on flatter surfaces and more triangles on complex surfaces) and also allows DEM data to be obtained from topographic features such as ridges, valley lines, topographic transition lines and other important topographic features that can be digitised to the required accuracy (Huang, Yu, and Huang 2010).\nAnd as for Radiometric calibration, the type of calibration is important for reliable quantitative measurements of images. However, when we use this method to calibrate images to reflectance, we do not usually see significant changes, but rather the main differences are in the spectral features associated with each pixel(Parks 2020).\n\n\n\nIn the case of data joining and enhancement, it is clear that the use of these methods to combine different images and enhance the visual appearance of the images will greatly assist us in our various studies. However, the exact method to be used will depend on the situation."

    "text": "3.2 Application\nAs I mentioned earlier, it is important to select a suitable method to correct, join or enhance images based on different scenarios and request.\nSpecifically, geometric correction and orthorectification correction are often used where there is a distortion in the image size. Geometric correction usually requires accurate control points on the ground and a reference image, whereas for orthorectification correction control points and DEM data are required.\nFor atmospheric correction, the method is not required in all cases, and when and how atmospheric effects are corrected depends on the available remote sensing and atmospheric data, the information required and the analysis method used to extract it. For many other applications involving image classification and change detection, atmospheric correction is not necessary, essentially, as long as the training data is from the image being classified. In other cases, correction is necessary to put the multi-temporal data on the same radiometric scale for monitoring the land surface over time(Song et al. 2001). in his paper, Song also evaluates specific operational methods, and his results show that DOS3 proves to be the best correction method: its calculation of Tv and Tz assumes only Rayleigh scattering, i.e. no aerosols (2001).\nFor Radiometric calibration, when it is necessary to calculate the spectral reflectance or spectral radiance of a feature, or when it is necessary to compare images acquired at different times and by different sensors, it is necessary to convert the image brightness grey scale values to absolute radiance, the reason for this is that the radiance information of the feature acquired by the remote sensor is subject to interference from atmospheric radiation, in addition to There are a series of systematic errors, such as recording noise, detector errors, etc. These all contribute to the distortion of the spectral brightness.\nFor data joining and enhancement, this is often the case when the image does not cover a large enough area and is not visually appealing. The researcher’s needs are met by enhancing and joining images."

    "title": "1  Week 1 Introduction of remote sensing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Figure 1.1: Mind map of week 1\n\n\nThe main content of this week is basic introduction of remote sensing, which gave us basic knowledge and awareness of remote sensing. To be specific, this week gave us the basic concepts of remote sensor devices, electromagnetic waves and data format.\n\n\nThe definition of remote sensing is acquire information from a distance(Earth Science Data Systems 2019). The tools which acquire information are called remote sensor. Sensors can be divided into many categories depending on the different classification criteria. If we classify remote sensing platforms according to their altitude, they can be broadly divided into space remote sensing, aerial remote sensing and ground remote sensing. The devices of space remote sensing include artificial satellites, manned spacecraft, space shuttles and space stations. Aerial remote sensing refers to the observation of the Earth from airborne platforms such as aircraft, spacecraft and balloons. Ground-based remote sensing refers to remote sensing technology systems where the sensors are set on the ground. According to the electromagnetic spectrum used, there are three types of remote sensing: visible, thermal infrared and microwave. In terms of working type, we can classify them into active remote sensing and passive remote sensing(Huang, Yu, and Huang 2010).\nConsidering that this week we mainly focus about the active sensors and passive sensors, in this case, I will mainly talk about above two sensors.\nThe huge difference between these two type of sensors is whether they have energy for illumination. Passive sensors cannot emit anything but detect reflected energy from sun. The power and frequency bands measured by passive sensors are determined by properties of the substance being measured. These frequencies and information cannot be changed nor duplicated in other bands(Mai 2012). As for active sensors, they send out signal by themselves and then measured when it is reflected by the surface of earth(Bhattacharyya, n.d.).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: The advantages and disadvantages of sensor devices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive sensor\n\nPassive sensor\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\n\n\nAll weather working\nRequire a large amount of power\nCannot be detected\nMost of them only can work in the day time\n\n\nSend out signal by itself\nHigh cost\nLow power consumption\nInfluence by weather(e.g. cloudy)\n\n\nObtain measurements anytime\nRadar signals contain no spectral characteristics.\nEasy to use for visual interpretation\n\n\n\nWeather, sunlight independent\nPulse power can be influenced or interfered by other radiation sources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Table 1.1 for the advantages and disadvantages of sensor devices.\n\n\n\n\nThe energy emitted by the sun and passive sensors is essentially electromagnetic waves. The wavelengths of electromagnetic waves can be classified as infrared, visible or ultraviolet light. We rely on this energy all the time in our lives, from the radio to sending text messages, electromagnetic waves are everywhere(NASA Official, n.d.).\n\n\nThe sun, as a full-spectrum source of energy, continuously transmits electromagnetic waves to the earth. Due to the atmosphere, before the solar radiation reaches the ground, some of its energy is absorbed, some are scattered and some are emitted. It is important to note that the atmosphere does not absorb and scatter radiation of different wavelengths to the same extent. In the visible wavelength range, the atmosphere is primarily responsible for scattering effects. The mode of scattering is related to the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, the diameter of the atmospheric molecules and the size of the aerosol particles. The main types of scattering are Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering and non-selective scattering. Rayleigh scattering occurs when the diameter of the particles in the atmosphere is much smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, and the shorter the wavelength the stronger the scattering, which is why the sky is blue in cloudless weather with good visibility. Mie scattering occurs when the wavelength is similar to the size of the scattering particles and is strongly influenced by the weather. When the size of the particles in the atmosphere is much larger than the wavelength, fog-selective scattering occurs, and clouds are an example of unselective scattering (which is why clouds are white: all visible light is involved in scattering)See Figure 1.2 and for scattering(Zhan 2001).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Day-time. Source: Zirui Guo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Twilight. Source: Zirui Guo\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Scattering\n\n\nThere are other effects in the natural environment, and the images presented need to be corrected for various reasons, see Chapter 3 for more details about correction.\n\n\n\n\nThe usual form of storage for remote sensing data is a raster. A raster consists of a series of pixels, each of which has the same size and shape. There are four types of resolution to consider for any data set - radiometric, spatial, spectral and temporal(Earth Science Data Systems 2019). The spatial resolution of a raster is the size (in meters) of each image element, which in turn is related to the ground area represented by the pixel(Wasser, n.d.). Temporal resolution is the minimum time interval between two adjacent remote sensing observations in the same area. The size of the time interval depends mainly on the type of sensor device: a large time interval results in a low temporal resolution and vice versa. The spectral resolution is the smallest wavelength interval that the sensor can resolve when receiving the spectrum of the target radiation. The smaller the interval, the higher the resolution. The different spectral resolution of the sensor on the same feature detection effect has a great difference. Radiation resolution refers to the ability of the sensor to distinguish between subtle changes in the radiation energy of a feature, i.e. the sensitivity of the sensor. The higher the radiometric resolution of a sensor, the stronger its ability to detect small changes in the reflected or emitted radiant energy of a feature. This is expressed in the remote sensing image as a quantitative level of radiation per image element."

    "text": "1.2 Application\nIn general, remote sensing data has a wide range of applications in many fields: pollution monitoring, night light of the city (see Figure 1.3 for night light of the city), forest fires, disaster monitoring (see Chapter 4 for remote sensing apply in disaster), these data not only help us in our research but also in our daily work.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Night light. Source: Google Earth\n\n\nSpecifically, in the field of ecology, for example, researchers have relied on remote sensing to model biogeochemical cycles and characterise land cover, vegetation biophysical properties, forest structure and fragmentation associated with biodiversity. Changes associated with clearcutting, interfering, tree mortality, acid rain, insect infestation, accidental harvesting, salvage logging, succession and interclass transition rates have been accurately characterized through the accumulation of data over many years(Cohen and Goward 2004).\nIn horticulture, the use of remote sensing to help collect and update information for scientific management plans and to reduce risk and minimize damage by collecting electromagnetic information to obtain accurate, large-scale information about the Earth’s surface and atmosphere has enabled horticultural crops to continue to play a role in increasing land productivity, creating jobs, increasing exports, improving the economic conditions of farmers and entrepreneurs, and providing food and nutrition security(Usha and Singh 2013).\nWildfires are a great danger to entire ecosystems, so understanding the dynamics associated with wildfires, such as risk, spatial distribution and impacts, is important for a clear understanding of their ecological impacts. Based on the inherently low-cost, multi-temporal nature of remote sensing, it has been applied to fire risk mapping, fuel mapping, active fire detection, area burned estimation, and burn severity assessment. It greatly improves the efficiency of the analysis and makes a significant contribution to prevention as well as post-disaster restoration(Szpakowski and Jensen 2019).\nRemote sensing is not only used on a large spatial scale but also plays an important role in engineering projects, where the use of LiDAR for building scanning and modelling has resulted in significant time and economic savings (see Chapter 2 for more details about the application of LiDAR)."

It is the southern gate of Aba Prefecture and is known as the “lock and key of western Sichuan” and the “gateway to western Qiang”. It is the hometown of Dayu. It is 1,326m above sea level, 159km from the provincial capital Chengdu and 204km from the state capital Markang(Aba Prefecture Government, 2008).\nEarthquakes in China tend to be densely distributed in zones, mainly in Taiwan, southwest China, northwest China, southeast coastal areas and 23 seismic zones（see Figure 4.1 for detail of earthquake zone distribution of China）. Where Sichuan province is located in the Yinchuan-Hetao seismic zone, which is also the dividing line between the seismic activity zones in the east and west of China(CAS, n.d.). The root cause of the frequent earthquakes in Sichuan is that it is located at the junction of the Asian-European and Indian Ocean plates, and is being squeezed by both plates, resulting in stresses that exceed the plate carrying capacity and generate fractures that eventually trigger earthquakes.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Earthquake zone distribution map of China. Source: Zhihu\n\n\nIn 2008, a massive earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale struck Wenchuan County, Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, killing 69,227 people, injuring 374,643 and leaving 17,923 missing(China News 2008). There are 10 counties (cities) in the very hardest-hit area, 41 counties (cities) in the harder-hit area, and 186 counties (cities) in the general hardest-hit area(Ministry of Civil Affairs 2008). The Wenchuan earthquake was the most destructive, widest-reaching, most costly and most difficult to respond to since the founding of the People’s Republic of China.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Chinese government and local authorities have developed a geological hazard prevention and control plan (60 pages) and an earthquake mitigation plan (20 pages) in each of their five-year plans. These two plans include geological hazard risk survey and evaluation, risk management, monitoring and early warning, avoidance and relocation, information construction and capacity building (Ministry of Natural Resources 2022; Sichuan Earthquake Administration 2021).\nThe earthquake prevention and mitigation plan states that there are still a number of problems in Sichuan: insufficient earthquake monitoring and forecasting capabilities, weak prevention and control capabilities in the face of disaster risks, and a lack of disaster relief capabilities and awareness among citizens(Sichuan Earthquake Administration 2021)."

Remote sensing geology has become a fundamental tool for earthquake research, and satellite technology, represented by satellite infrared, InSAR, and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), has played an important role in earthquake monitoring and forecasting(Shen et al. 2013).\nSpecifically, the use of satellite remote sensing (SRS) imagery and the use of building damage index (DI) to assess the extent of damage to buildings can be applied to earthquake casualty estimation(Feng et al. 2013). In fact, the number of casualties can be estimated not only from the extent of building damage but also from nighttime light images: the population can be estimated by using the extent and density of light and comparing before and after images to determine the number of people affected(He et al. 2022).\nRemote sensing is also playing an increasingly important role in the field of earthquake prediction. The reason why earthquakes can be predicted is that they are preceded by anomalous signs: thermal anomaly, electromagnetic signal anomaly, crustal deformation, and gravity anomaly, of which thermal remote sensing is the most widely used, electromagnetic remote sensing is the most accurate, GPS is the most direct, and gravity remote sensing is the least used(Zhao et al. 2021). The thermal anomaly is the most widely used, the electromagnetic anomaly is the most accurate, the GPS is the most direct in observing crustal deformation, and the gravity anomaly is the least used(Zhao et al. 2021).\nOf course, remote sensing can also be applied to post-disaster reconstruction assessment. See Figure 4.2 for detail of the differences.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: The change of Beichuan county from 2008 to 2010.

    "text": "Figure 6.1: Mind map of week 6\n\n\nThis week we mainly talked about the concepts of machine learning(ML). Generally speaking, there are three types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. In this week’s study, we will focus on supervised and unsupervised learning.\n\n\nLet us start with the definition of supervised learning, which refers to learning a function (model parameters) from a given training dataset, from which results can be predicted when new data arrives. The training set requirements for supervised learning include the inputs and outputs, which can also be described as features and objectives. The targets in the training set are human-labelled. The common algorithms for supervised learning are classification and regression.\n\n\nThe CART algorithm can be used to create both classification trees and regression trees, and contains three features:\n\nBinary Split: In each judgement process, the sample data is dichotomised.\nSplit Based on One Variable: Each optimal split is on a single variable.\nPruning strategy\n\nClassification trees are used when the prediction target is a discrete value. Classification trees are used to classify data into two or more discrete (can only have certain values) categories and use the Gini coefficient as the basis for node splitting. The Gini coefficient formula is as follows:\n\\[Gini(D)=1-\\sum_{k=1}^k p_k^2\\]\nThe Gini coefficient represents the impurity of the model; the smaller the Gini coefficient, the lower the impurity and the better the characteristics.\nWhen predicting continuous dependent variables, regression trees are used and the MSE is used as the basis for nodal splitting.\n\n\n\nOverfitting means that the model performs well on the training set, but generalises poorly to the test set and new data sets. The reasons for this are:\n\ntoo little data in the training set\ninconsistent data distribution in the training and test sets\nthe model itself is particularly complex\n\nThere are a number of solutions to this situation:\n\nLimit how trees grow\nWeakest link pruning - Change the number of leaves in each tree\nChanging Alpha\n\n\n\n\nThe core idea of random forests is many better than one, specifically, each tree is constructed by selecting a fixed number of samples from the entire training sample set, and then selecting a fixed number of feature sets to build each decision tree in the random forest, with the final result determined by the principle of majority rule.\nThe advantages of random forests are clear:\n\nHas a very high accuracy rate\nCan be run efficiently on large data sets\nDoes not require dimensionality reduction\nthe importance of individual features in the classification problem can be evaluated\nAn unbiased estimate of the internal generation error can be obtained during the generation process\ncan also obtain good results for default value problems\n\nHowever, it also has the unavoidable disadvantage that\n\nThe model is too general and does not have the ability to handle too difficult samples correctly\n\n\n\n\nSVM is a binary classification model that maps the feature vector of an instance to a number of points in space.\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to supervised learning, the unsupervised learning training set does not provide correct results, but allows the algorithm to try to identify similarities between different data so that data with common features can be grouped together.\nCommon algorithms for unsupervised learning are DBSCAN (See more detail at CASA 005), hierarchical clustering, K-means."

Based on above strength, machine learning is used to assess pelagic Sargassum distribution. To be specific, researchers use random forest algorithm to calculated four vegetation indices and one floating-algae index so that they can implement a supervised classification with band 2 and 5(Cuevas, Uribe-Martínez, and Liceaga-Correa 2018).\nAnother interesting example of using machine learning is to calculate land cover and land use in south-central Sweden. In this research, people use four non-parametric algorithms(SVM, RF, Xgboost and DL) and compare their classification performance. The outcomes indicate that four algorithms produced similar overall accuracy between 0.733 to 0.758(Abdi 2020).\n\n\n\nClassification.

But we still need to figure out whether use them or classified by ourselves.\n\n\nCompared to traditional image classification which is based on pixel. OBIA segments an image grouping pixels together into vectors rather than per-pixel(GISGeography 2014). This way of classification not only has obvious advantage but also it can by applied to medium and low resolution as well.\n\n\n\nAccuracy is a key factor to evaluate of our model is reliable or not. In remote sensing we usually care about the following indicators:\n\nPA Producer accuracy\n\n\\[(\\frac{TP}{TP+FN})\\]\n\nUA User’s accuracy\n\n\\[(\\frac{TP}{TP+FP})\\]\n\nOA Overall accuracy\n\n\\[(\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+FN+TN})\\]\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Source: Barsi et al. 2018 Accuracy Dimensions in Remote Sensing\n\n\n\nKappa coefficient: used for consistency testing and can also be used to measure classification accuracy\n\n\\[k = \\frac{p_0-p_e}{1-p_e}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering that we cannot own high recall and high precision at the same time. In this case, we introduce a new indicator F1 score which combine above two indicators altogether.\n\\[F1 = \\frac{TP}{TP+\\frac{1}{2}*(FP+FN)}\\] However F1 score has its own issue as well. To be specific, there is no TN in the equation.\n\n\n\nROC curve also known as sensitivity curve. The reason for this name is that the points on the curve reflect the same sensibility, and they are all responses to the same signaling stimulus, but the result of several different criteria.\nSo why we use ROC curve? Because ROC cruve has a good characteristic: the ROC curve can be kept constant when the distribution of positive and negative samples in the test set changes. In real scenario, class imbalance often occurs, i.e., there are many more negative samples than positive samples (or vice versa), and the distribution of positive and negative samples in the test data may change over time. See Figure 7.3 for detail of ROC and Precision-Recall curve(a, c are ROC curves, b, d are Precision-Recall curves).\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Comparison between ROC curve and Precision-Recall curve. Source: CSDN\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial cross validation is used to assess whether there is overfitting when data is autocorrelated."

Reduce noise and enhance classification accuracy.\nRecently OBIA has been widely applied on the study of wetland. By using OBIA, it can alleviate wetland’s local spatial heterogeneity, especially with high resolution data. Another contribution of OBIA is that it can facilitate the approach of hierarchy to detection and classification the component of wetland(Dronova 2015)."

So this week we had a number of discussion around temperature and discussed its causes and related policies.\n\n\nThe definition of urban heat island is there is a temperature differences between urban and rural area. In summer, this effect will amplifies high temperature heat waves, which means that when encountering high temperature weather, the temperature difference will be higher as well.\nUrban heat island is caused by crowded pavements, buildings covering natural land. This effect will cost a large amount of energy cost, pollution(US EPA 2015). And SVF(sky view factor), air speed, cloud play important role on this as well.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: London urban heat island map.

For example, due to heatwave, there are more than 2800 people whose age are more than 65 died in England, which is hightest excess death toll at least two decades(Goodier and Carrington 2022). And of course, with the increase of growing temperature, there is denying that the consumption of fuel, electricity will grow as well."

To be specific, the local government separate pedestrian and vehicular traffic to create green streets and bring more space for pedestrians and bicycles and minimize area used by cars(Okumus 2022).\nIn Milan, instead of trying to provide extra green space on the ground, the architects in Italy decide to bring more green space in the vertical direction, in this case, they design a vertical forest in the city(Stefano Boeri Architect 2022). Unlike glass or stone, plants won’t reflect or magnify radiation from sun, on the contrary, they filter it and create a microclimate.\nIt is a quite good attempt, especially the project doesn’t have high demand of land, because all green space are at vertical direction, which means compared to apply superblock to other cities, This project is much easier to be applied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Vertical forest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Inside vertical forest\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Vertical forest.

In his opinion, it would be useful to addressing global warming and high temperature by painting rooftop and cars. White roofs can reduce a building’s electricity bill by 10% to 20%, says the Department of Energy(Hargreaves 2009). But this project doesn’t get to the root of the problem, i.e., it doesn’t systematically reduce air temperature."
